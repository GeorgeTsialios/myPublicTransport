# myPublicTransport

This is a project for the Interactive Technologies Course of the 9th semester of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Patras. The subject of this design project is online ticket booking applications for public means of transport. It consists of the following steps:

- First, we analyze the problem using both user analysis and task analysis techniques. Then, we perform a case study of the Hellenic Train application and we evaluate its User Experience, using both expert-based and user-based evaluation methods.
- In an attempt to improve the Hellenic Train application, we redesign it in Figma using human-centered design principles.
- Lastly, we evaluate our new design and compare it to the original Hellenic Train application. Both quantitative and qualitative metrics show that our design is preferable in terms of usability and User Experience.
